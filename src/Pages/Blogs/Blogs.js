                            <p>In React applications, we are guaranteed a very fast UI by default. However, as an application grows, developers may encounter some performance issues.
                                In this guide, we will discuss five important ways to optimize 
                                the performance of a React application, including pre-optimization techniques.</p>

                            <p>When we talk about state in our applications, itâ€™s important to be clear about what types of state actually matter.
                                There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:<br/>
                                1. Local state.<br/>
                                2. Global state.<br/>
                                3. Server state.<br/>
                                4. URL state.<br/>

                        How does prototypical inheritance work?

                            <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript
                                used to add methods and properties in objects.
                                It is a method by which an object can inherit the
                                properties and methods of another object.</p>

                            <p>React provides a method called setState for this purpose.
                                setState() enqueues changes to the component state and tells
                                React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered
                                with the updated state.</p>

                            Firstly, we import useState from react . 
                            Then, we import the Scroll and SearchList components.
                            Next, in the Search function, we use the useState hook to 
                            initialise the value of the searchField state with useState("") 
                            (an empty string). After this, we use the filter function on the details
                            list received from the parent.

                            <p>Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.</p>
